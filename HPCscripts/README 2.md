# Additional scripts to generate macros / submitt jobs

- `grid_response.py`: Genreates macros to use when simulating
  the response for many incident energies
- ` grid_simulations.py` and `grid_inbeam.py` are examples of how the geometry
  can be changed by macros, thus that one can optimize some parameters of 
  the geometry
- `submitt_scripts` contains examples of how to submitt the scripts on the fram HPC using a helper script called [launcher](https://github.com/TACC/launcher)
